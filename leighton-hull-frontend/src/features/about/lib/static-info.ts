export const aboutLegacyInfo = `Legacy isn’t just what we leave in assets, it is the strength, wisdom, and values we pass on.`;

export const aboutOwnerQuote = `I've been the owner, the operator, and the advisor. It's that real-world experience that helps me see not just what's broken-but how to fix it.`;

export const aboutOwnerBackground = `His entrepreneurial journey began in 1985 with the launch of his first McDonald's franchise in Los Angeles. A hands-on leader from the start, Hull quickly earned recognition for his operational rigor and commitment to service excellence. Hull conducted rigorous multi-day evaluations of prospective McDonald's franchisees—a critical screening role focused on identifying leadership capacity and a true service mindset. As a Certified Operations Instructor within the McDonald's system, Hull was selected to personally train prospective franchisees at one of his McDonald's stores, which served as an official training site and operational model within the system. Hull was also elected to the Board of Directors of the McDonald's Franchisee Association and served on the brand's Marketing Committee.`;

export const aboutOwnerExpansion = `He expanded into Denny's, Shell stations, convenience stores, car washes, and real estate developments—applying his operator's lens to every business he touched. Hull later built and operated Bojangles restaurants in Georgia, bringing a hands-on leadership approach to the Southern QSR market. His first Bojangles unit was selected as the system's first national franchise training site - a distinction that reflected Hull's operational leadership and commitment to excellence. He was also elected to the Board of Directors of the Bojangles Franchisee Association, further reinforcing his legacy of leadership across brands.`;

export const aboutOwnerEarlyCareer = `Earlier in his career, Hull worked in the marketing division of Cummins Engine Company before being appointed Regional Director for the Indiana Department of Commerce.

export const funFactsAboutOwnerInfo = `FUN FACTS`;

export const funFactDescription1 = `For Leighton, flying has always been more than transportation — it's freedom. As a licensed private pilot, he sometimes treats flying like others treat driving: grabbing lunch and taking off for a quick flight, or heading to a meeting a few hours away and still being home for dinner. The cockpit is both a place of focus and relaxation, where every takeoff is a reminder of discipline and perspective.`;

export const funFactDescription2 = `On the water, life slows down. Leighton is an ASA-certified sailor who treasures the rhythm of open seas. Some of his favorite memories are the simplest ones: a sunny afternoon on the ocean with friends, jazz playing in the background, barbecue on deck, and the steady pull of the wind filling the sails.`;

export const funFactDescription3 = `Before business became his stage, Leighton had starring roles in high school and college productions. For a time, he dreamed of life as an actor, but ultimately chose the surer path of entrepreneurship. The performer never left him, though - and that presence, timing, and sense of storytelling carry into every boardroom, fireside chat, and keynote.`;

export const aboutSuccess = `Success doesn’t come overnight.  It’s built one step, one decision, and one challenge at a time.`;

export const aboutTimeline = `Long before the franchises and the boardrooms, there was a young man with a pilot's license and a vision. This timeline traces the key entrepreneurial milestones in Leighton Hull's storied business life.`;
